I am a PhD Candidate in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Michigan, advised by Professor Ram Vasudevan. I am a member of the Robotics and Optimization of Human Motion ([ROAHM](http://www.roahmlab.com/)) Lab and the Ford Center for Autonomous Vehicles ([FCAV](https://fcav.engin.umich.edu)). My current work focuses on the development and testing of algorithms for securing cyber-physical systems, through mathematical analysis and physical experimentation.

I am originally from Blissfield, Michigan. I received my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Michigan Technological University in 2014 and my M.S.E in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Michigan in 2017.
