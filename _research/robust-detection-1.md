description: Cyber-physical systems from aircraft autopilot systems to smart home devices are becoming increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, providing us with convenience, safety and efficiency. Similarly future systems such as autonomous vehicles continue this trend. However, many of the current and future cyber-physical systems are vulnerable to attacks. For attacks that alter the content of external communications, control theoretic approaches such as Dynamic Watermarking provide a means of detection. My work has focused on extending previous methods in Dynamic Watermarking to an increasingly broad range of systems. For more information, see my recent publications.
